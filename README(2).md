## What Is Quantitative Research?

Quantitative research focuses on:
- Numerical data  
- Statistical analysis  
- Objective measurement  
- Identifying patterns and relationships  

It is commonly used in:
- Social sciences  
- Education  
- Psychology  
- Economics  
- Health sciences  

---

## Key Characteristics

- **Structured**: Uses standardized tools (surveys, tests, instruments)  
- **Objective**: Researcher keeps distance  
- **Replicable**: Procedures are clearly defined  
- **Large samples**: Strengthens statistical validity  
- **Statistical inference**: Allows generalization to populations  

---

## Common Quantitative Research Designs

### 1. Descriptive Research
Describes characteristics, frequencies, or distributions.  
**Examples:**
- Prevalence rate of internet use  
- Average test scores  

---

### 2. Correlational Research
Examines relationships between variables.  
**Examples:**
- Relationship between study time and GPA  
- Link between stress and productivity  

---

### 3. Experimental Research
Manipulates an independent variable to test cause–effect.  
**Examples:**
- Testing effectiveness of a new teaching method  
- Clinical trials  

---

### 4. Quasi-Experimental Research
Like experimental research but without full randomization.  
**Examples:**
- Comparing two classrooms without random assignment

## Types of Data

| Data Type | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Nominal** | Categories without order | Gender, hair color |
| **Ordinal** | Ordered categories | Likert scale (1–5) |
| **Interval** | Equal intervals, no true zero | Temperature (°C) |
| **Ratio** | Equal intervals + true zero | Height, weight, income |

## Sampling Methods

- **Random sampling**  
- **Systematic sampling**  
- **Stratified sampling**  
- **Cluster sampling**  
- **Convenience sampling**  

---

## Data Collection Methods

### Surveys & Questionnaires
- Closed-ended questions  
- Likert scales  
- Multiple-choice items  

### Tests & Assessments
- Standardized instruments  
- Objective scoring  

### Observational Checklists
- Structured observation with numeric ratings  

---

## Statistical Analysis

### Descriptive Statistics
- Mean  
- Median  
- Mode  
- Standard deviation  
- Frequency tables  

---

### Inferential Statistics
- t-tests  
- ANOVA  
- Correlation (Pearson r)  
- Regression analysis  
- Chi-square tests

## Example Research Question

**“Does the amount of daily screen time predict academic performance among high school students?”**

- **Independent variable:** Screen time (hours/day)  
- **Dependent variable:** Academic performance (GPA)  
- **Method:** Correlational survey  
- **Analysis:** Pearson correlation

## Advantages of Quantitative Research

- Produces precise numerical data  
- Allows statistical testing  
- Enables generalization  
- High reliability  
- Efficient for large samples  

---

## Limitations

- May overlook context  
- Less focus on meaning and experiences  
- Rigid structure  
- Potential measurement bias  

---

## Mixed Methods (Brief Mention)

Combines quantitative (numeric) and qualitative (textual) approaches.  
Useful when:
- One method alone is insufficient  
- Triangulation increases validity  
- Both breadth and depth are needed  

---

## Summary

Quantitative research is:
- Objective  
- Systematic  
- Statistical  
- Generalizable  

It helps researchers **explain**, **predict**, and **test** relationships between variables.
